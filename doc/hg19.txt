Note on chrM
Since the release of the UCSC hg19 assembly, the Homo sapiens mitochondrion sequence (represented as "chrM" in the Genome Browser) has been replaced in GenBank with the record NC_012920. We have not replaced the original sequence, NC_001807, in the hg19 Genome Browser. We plan to use the Revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) in the next human assembly release. 

Chromosome naming scheme
In addition to the "regular" chromosomes, the hg19 browser contains nine haplotype chromosomes and 59 unplaced contigs. If an unplaced contig is localized to a chromosome, the contig name is appended to the regular chromosome name, as in chr1_gl000191_random. If the chromosome is unknown, the contig is represented with the name "chrUn" followed by the contig identifier, as in chrUn_gl000211. Note that the chrUn contigs are no longer placed in a single, artificial chromosome as they have been in previous UCSC assemblies. See the sequences page for a complete list of hg19 chromosome names. 

 The Y chromosome in this assembly contains two pseudoautosomal regions (PARs) that were taken from the corresponding regions in the X chromosome and are exact duplicates:

    chrY:10001-2649520 and chrY:59034050-59363566
    chrX:60001-2699520 and chrX:154931044-155260560
