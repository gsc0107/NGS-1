An OptiSpotter™ project typically starts with our firm advising your researchers  on how to refactor 
their research code from long-running serial jobs to independent components. 
If the research is already organized in such components, Princeton Consultants’ experts can help you take 
the next step by transforming code from “cloud friendly” to “spot friendly.”

We then employ a special software framework that runs your research in Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) 
Spot Instances. OptiSpotter™ monitors the pricing and availability in real time and uses custom optimization 
algorithms to dispatch the pieces to the fastest, lowest cost collection of processors--potentially spread 
across instance types and availability zones. OptiSpotter™ contains a continuous solve model that both replans 
unrun jobs and reschedules jobs that have been cancelled.
