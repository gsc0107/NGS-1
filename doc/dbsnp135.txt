dbsnp135 is out. 

Here is an example of 3 records in dbsnp 135:

bin	585	585	585
chrom	chr1	chr1	chr1
chromStart	10144	10233	10433
chromEnd	10145	10234	10433
name	rs144773400	rs145599635	rs56289060
score	0	0	0
strand	+	+	+
refNCBI	A	C	-
refUCSC	A	C	-
observed	-/A	C/T	-/C
molType	genomic	genomic	genomic
class	deletion	single	insertion
valid	unknown	unknown	unknown
avHet	0	0	0
avHetSE	0	0	0
func	unknown	near-gene-5	near-gene-5
locType	exact	exact	between
weight	1	1	1
exceptions			
submitterCount	1	1	1
submitters	BL,	BL,	HGSV,
alleleFreqCount	0	0	0

?according to the sql, there are extra lines of alleles, alleleNs,
alleleFreqs, bitfields? where are they?

Note:
1. chromStart and chromEnd follow the BED format, which starts from 0,
half-close, half-open. To calculate the 1-based coordinate, it should be 
chr:chromStart+1-chromEnd

2. bgzip and tabix
bgzip -c hg19_snp135.txt > hg19_snp135.txt.gz
tabix -s 2 -b 3 -e4 hg19_snp135.txt.gz

to retrieve rsID based on coordinates, we do:
tabix hg19_snp135.txt.gz chr1:10145-10145
