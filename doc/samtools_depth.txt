The maximum depth of coverage is around 8091. Where is the bug hiding?

samtools assumes multiple bam files. To calculate the total coverage,
we have to iterate through all bam files.

n_plp[i]  is the number of covering reads for a position from the i-th BAM.
bam_mplp_auto(mplp, &tid, &pos, n_plp, plp) will return a n_plp.
